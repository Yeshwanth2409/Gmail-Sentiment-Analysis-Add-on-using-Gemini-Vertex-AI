**Lab Duration**: 1 hour 30 minutes  
**Level**: Introductory  
**Credit Value**: 1

---

##  Overview

In this lab, you'll build a Google Workspace add-on for Gmail that leverages **Gemini** and **Vertex AI** to perform sentiment analysis on email content. This tool enables users to automatically detect and label negative tones in emails—ideal for prioritizing customer service responses or flagging sensitive communications.

---

##  What You'll Learn

- Create a Google Workspace add-on using **Apps Script** that extends Gmail's functionality  
- Integrate **Gemini** and **Vertex AI** to run sentiment analysis within Gmail  
- Securely enable the add-on using **OAuth2 authentication**  
- Programmatically analyze email content and label it based on emotional tone (e.g., "UPSET", "NEUTRAL", "HAPPY")

---

##  Prerequisites & Setup

- Use an **Incognito or private browser window** to avoid conflicts with personal Google accounts  
- Lab environments provide **temporary credentials** (username & password); do **not** use your own Google account to avoid unintended charges  
- Familiarity with **Google Cloud Console**, **Apps Script**, and basic OAuth2 configurations is helpful but not required

---

##  Lab Steps (Checkpoints)

1. **Start Lab & Access Environment**  
   - Click *Start Lab* and open the Google Cloud console using the provided credentials  

2. **Configure Cloud Environment**  
   - Enable the **Vertex AI API**  
   - Set up the **OAuth consent screen** for secure access  

3. **Build the Add-on**  
   - Create an **Apps Script project** linked to your GCP project  
   - Populate the script files and manifest (`appsscript.json`) with the required logic  

4. **Deploy & Test**  
   - Deploy the Gmail add-on  
   - Authorize access via OAuth2 and use the add-on to label emails by sentiment  
   - Test with sample or real emails to verify functionality  

5. **Completion**  
   - Check your progress at each step  
   - Congratulations—you're done when you see the final message!

##  Outcome

By the end of the lab, you'll have a functioning Gmail add-on capable of analyzing and labeling emails by sentiment. This project not only demonstrates AI in action but also enhances workflow efficiency by helping users handle problematic emails more effectively.
